Project Overview
  -This project leverages SQL and Tableau to analyze maintenance costs, repair needs, and replacement values of federal properties. The goal is to provide insights into asset efficiency and identify properties that may require repairs or replacement to optimize resource allocation.

Key Insights & Features
  -Cost Analysis: Evaluates total maintenance, operations, and repair costs by state.
  -Decision Framework: Uses SQL-based logic to categorize properties as “Repair Recommended” or “Consider Replacement” based on cost thresholds.
  -Geospatial Insights: Interactive maps highlight states and cities with high concentrations of underutilized properties.
  -Trend Analysis: Tracks historical patterns of underutilization to identify when and where inefficiencies begin.
  -Actionable Recommendations: Helps property managers prioritize investments and budget allocation.

Technologies Used
  -SQL (PostgreSQL) – Data cleaning, transformation, and cost-based decision modeling.
  -Tableau – Data visualization through maps, scatter plots, and time-series charts.
  -Excel – Initial data exploration and formatting.

How to Use the Dashboard
  -Navigate the Map – Explore states and cities with high costs or underutilization.
  -Hover for Details – View property-specific insights using tooltips.
  -Filter by Category – Adjust filters to focus on maintenance costs, operations costs, or repair needs.
  -Compare to Replacement Value – Identify “money pit” properties with excessive costs relative to their value.

Impact
  -This dashboard serves as a decision-making tool for property managers, enabling data-driven budget optimization and resource efficiency improvements across federal assets.
